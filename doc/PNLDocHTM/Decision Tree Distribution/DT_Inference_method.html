	<tr><td><p>We want to implement inference algorithm on Bayesian networks which include decision Tree  nodes. 
		Inference implementation in Bayesian networks, which include Decision Tree nodes, is possible when all asked parents of Decision Tree node are observed (otherwise it is imposible to find Decision Tree node distribution because there are no ways to the terminal node). In Gibbs Sampling Algorithm on each iteration all nodes ecxept one (current node) are pseudo-observed so we use it on networks with Decision Tree nodes.
	<br>Here is a short scheme of algorithm:
	<ul type=disc>
	<li>Potentials creation.
	<li>First sample generation.
	<li>Sample cycle.
	</ul>
On the first step a potential for every node in the net is created. If the initial node has tabular distribution, then potential will be Tabular, otherwise it will be Gaussian. In discrete case, distribution matrix equal  a vector with the lenth that is equal a node size.  
While generate the first sample, the descent on Desicion Tree node tree up to the terminal vertex are realized. This procedure is correct, because parent nodes values, which are already generated, are used and net is topologically sorted. After that we generate value on this node using distribution, which corresponds to definite terminal vertex.
<br>During the main cycle every node of the net is processed in two cases:
<ul type=disc>
<li>when a new value of the node is generated (in sample for this node);
<li>when a new value on one of the node parents is generated (in sample for parent).
</ul>
Handling processes in both situations are very close.
For generating new value on the node, we need to know marginal distribution on this node, which consider distributions on it’s children.
