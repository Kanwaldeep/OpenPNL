	<tr><td><p>The algorithm of diagnostics consists in calculating a priority of performing a tests for reduction of uncertainty of the diagnosis. For that it is necessary to define a list of target nodes.
The following algorithm solves that problem. The input parameters are:
    <ul type=disc>
	<li>The list of target nodes for which it is necessary to reduce uncertainty.
	<li>The list of target states for these nodes.
	</ul>
At the output parameter is the list of test nodes in ascending order.
Because small and large joint probabilities are only possible when the marginal probabilities are either small or large. 
Generally it is necessary to estimate benefit of performing each set of test nodes. We suppose that only one test is available now because in the other case it`s computational impracticable problem. Benefit of performing a test is estimated by the following formula:

<br>Cost(T) is cost of performing a test (observation) T. 
<br>V(Pr(H)) is a value function.
