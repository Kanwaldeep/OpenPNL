		The SoftMax node (the node with softmax probability distribution) is a discrete node, which has continuous parents. Let SoftMax nodeY has m possible values. We define <br> <img src="formula_1.gif" align="center"> <br> where <i>b</i> and <i>W</i> is a parameters of SoftMax distribution. <i>W</i> is called weight matrix. It is two-dimensional matrix, it’s size is (Number of continuous parents)X(Number of SoftMax node states = <i>m</i>). In weight matrix columns are not independent. It is known that if we subtract last column from all, we’ll get <i>(m-1)</i> independent columns. That is why in our formula only first columns are used (<i>W<sub>j</sub></i> is a column of this matrix after subtraction). <i>b</i> is an offset vector. It has <i>m</i> elements, but they are not independent, to overcome dependences we have to subtract last offset vector element from all others. <p>When Softmax node has both discrete and continuous parents, we define probability distribution with weight matrix and offset vector r 		every possible state combination of discrete parents. Such distribution is called conditional SoftMax.</p></td>
